# Musical Experience (musexp) Game Rules

Copyright 2016 Jonathan Windle

## Overview

The musical experience game is designed to be played with two players. The
object of the game is for the participants to learn about each others musical
tastes while also sharing general themes of human experiences they find
interesting or relevant to their lives in some way.

## How to Play

### Who goes first

Out of the two participants decide which one of the players will be going first
in selecting a topic. This is usually best decided by some random fact about the
participants that is unknown to both.

For example:

* Whose birthday day comes first in the year?
* Who last took a shower?
* Whose Chinese zodiac animal would win in a bar fight?

### First participant selects a topic

The participant selected to go first now chooses a topic and a track of music
that they feel best represents that topic for them.

For example:

* Happiness & "_You Are My Sunshine/Just Dance_" by Jonathan Bastiste & The Stay
  Human Band
* Rebellion & "_East Jesus Nowhere_" by Green Day
* The genocide of human experience through the cultural uprising of the Internet
  & "_Huew Newton_" + "_Digital Witness_" by St. Vincent

### Second participant agrees or challenges

#### Agree

The second participant can simply agree with the first's selection. If they
choose to agree the second participant should provide a brief statement on
why they think that the topic and the musical selection is a good match.

If the first participant has a differing opinion on why it is a good match
friendly (or not so friendly) debate may ensue.

#### Challenge

The second participant may also challenge by presenting another piece of music
that they find to be more relevant to the topic than the first participant's
selection. They should also provide a statement as to why they think their
selection is a better match than the first participant's selection.

As before friendly debate may ensue and is encouraged.

### Switch and repeat

After coming to an agreement (or disagreement as the case may be) the
participant who was previously second now takes the role of the first
participant and the process repeats.

The game continues until one of the following conditions are met:

* A predetermined number of rounds have passed previously agreed upon by the
  participants

OR

* One or both of the participants
    * is really board and can't imagine why they agreed to play this game
    * now has complete disdain for the others music selection
    * are audiophiles, deeply enjoy the other participants music selection, and
      now need to get a room
