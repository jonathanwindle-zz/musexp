## Overview

For those participants who would like to play the Musical Experience Game with a
little more complication or simply have trouble seeing the point of a good
conversation without a higher objective (you know who you are), these rules have
been written with you in mind.

While the rules documented here are a good starting point for customizing your
game play, participants are encouraged to make up their own rules and customize
the game in a way that best fits their style of play.

## Playing for points (aka I really need to feel like I'm winning)

A point system can be added to your game by counting each **agreement** made by
the second participant as a point for the first, and each **challenge** as a
point that goes to the participant that picked the more relevant piece of music
for the topic that was chosen.

While playing with a point system, use one of the following rules to determine
when then game ends.

The game ends when:

* A certain number points is reached by one of the participants
* A time limit is reached
* A certain number of rounds have elapsed

### Causal play

In causal play the points are given by the opposite player. A point is only
assigned when both participants agree that the other deserves the point. In the
case of a challenge where the participants agree to disagree no point is
assigned.

### Competitive play

In competitive play where both participants have a vested interest in winning
an unbiased third party needs to be selected to judge which participant gets a
point during challenges. The third party may be an individual entity or a group
of multiple entities.

The third party does still have the option to decide the challenge is a draw
resulting in no point being assigned to either participant. Participants may
reserve the right to call the third party names such as “weak sauce” when such
a decision is made.

### Cover songs and mixes

Cover songs as well as mixes of the same piece of music are to be treated as
original works, except during a challenge where the first participant's musical
selection is the original work, cover, or mix of the second participant's chosen
musical composition. In this scenario when the challenge results in a draw the
first participant automatically receives a point.

## Increasing the difficulty

### Timed turns within rounds

Timed turns can increase difficulty but also courtesy to each participants time
spent waiting for the other. To added timed turns agree upon a maximum time
each participant can spend as first and the second participant during each
round of play.

This works similar to a chess timer that limits the amount of time each player
can spend taking their turn during chess.

### Limiting repetitions of album or artist

Participants may experience increased difficulty by limiting the number of times
they may use a piece of music from the same album or artist, either sequentially
or in total.

For example players may not select the same album or artist:

* More than one time in a row
* As the other participant when challenging
* Until the game ends
* Forever as along as they play with the same participants

#### Dealing with various artist albums and singles

Pieces of music are always attributed to the first album which they were
released, except in the case where the piece of music was released as a single
and later included in an album released by the same artist. When a piece of
music has only been released as a single the single is to be treated as if it is
its own album.

### Playing with disadvantage

Adding this rule will increase difficulty for one of the participants while
making it less difficult for the opposite. Add this rule by letting the first
participant continue to go first each round until they have received a point.
Once the first participant receives a point the second participant becomes the
first participant the following round and stays so until they have received a
point in a round.

### Playing with advantage

This is the opposite of playing with disadvantage. Add this rule by allowing
the last player to receive a point to go first in the next round.
